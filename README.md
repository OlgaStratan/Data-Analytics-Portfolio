# Data Analytics Projects Portfolio 

My Data Analytics projects portfolio contains a wide range of projects that showcase my skills in data analytics using SQL, Excel and Tableau. I have worked on various types of projects including data cleaning, descriptive analytics, dashboards, visualizations and reports.

In particular, I have expertise in building dashboards for insight generation. My dashboard designs are highly interactive and customized to business needs to maximize the impact of insights generated from datasets. Additionally, I have successfully used data cleaning techniques such as Pivot Tables and VLOOKUP to prepare datasets for analysis. I am also adept at creating tables, charts and graphs for better visualization of results in Tableau.
