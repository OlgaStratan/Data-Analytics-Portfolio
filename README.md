# Data Analytics Project with SQL and Tableau
## In this project I was using SQL (Microsoft SQL Server) to do some Data Exploration and then visualize the data in Tableau.

## Data Collection
For this project I used the Covid 19 Data from [Our World
in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

The first part of the project performs some data exploration with basic SQL queries that involves statements like Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types.

The initial CSV dataset contains some demographics information like location, population count, median age, gdp per capita, and medication history. Besides, it records covid tracking information starting on January 1st, 2020. This table records the new and total case count, number of death cases, and vaccination count on each day. I have splited the dataset into two separate tables, **CovidDeaths** and **CovidVaccination**,in order to use JOIN statement.
