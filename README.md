# Data Analytics Projects Portfolio 

My Data Analytics projects portfolio contains a wide range of projects that showcase my skills in data analytics using SQL, Excel and Tableau. I have worked on various types of projects including data cleaning, data exploration, descriptive analytics, dashboards, visualizations and reports.

In particular, I have expertise in building dashboards for insight generation. My dashboard designs are highly interactive and customized to business needs to maximize the impact of insights generated from datasets. Additionally, I have successfully used data cleaning techniques such as Pivot Tables and VLOOKUP to prepare datasets for analysis. I am also adept at creating tables, charts and graphs for better visualization of results in Tableau.

## Project 1: [Google Data Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Case Study](https://github.com/OlgaStratan/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/tree/main/Google%20Data%20Analytics%20Capstone:%20Cyclistic%20Case%20study)

The purpose of this project is to provide insights in order to make data-driven decisions for marketing strategies that would convert casual riders into members. 

In this project I have followed the 6 Data Analytics stages: **Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act.**

I used **Microsoft SQL Server** for data processing, data cleaning, validation, and exploration, and I also used **Tableau Desktop** for data visualization.

## Project 2: [Data Cleaning Project (SQL)](https://github.com/OlgaStratan/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/tree/main/QSL_Data_Cleaning_Project)
In this project, I was using Microsoft SQL Server to clean [Nashville Housing dataset](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx). The Dataset has more than 56,000 rows and 19 columns.

The following tasks were performed:
- **Standardize date format**
- **Populate missing property address data**
- **Parsing long-formatted address into individual columns (Address, City, State)**
- **Standardize “Sold as Vacant” field (from Y/N to Yes and No)**
- **Remove Duplicates**

## Project 3: [Data Analytics Project with Excel](https://github.com/OlgaStratan/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/tree/main/Data_Analytics_with_Excel)

In this project I was using Excel for data cleaning, data analysis and data visualization.

## Project 4: [Data Analytics Project with SQL and Tableau](https://github.com/OlgaStratan/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/tree/main/Data%20Analyst%20Portfolio%20Project%20Covid)

In this project I was using SQL (Microsoft SQL Server) for Data Exploration and Tableau for further Data Visualization
