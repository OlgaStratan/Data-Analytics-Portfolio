# Data Analytics Projects Portfolio 

My Data Analytics projects portfolio contains a wide range of projects that showcase my skills in data analytics using SQL, Excel and Tableau. I have worked on various types of projects including data cleaning, descriptive analytics, dashboards, visualizations and reports.

In particular, I have expertise in building dashboards for insight generation. My dashboard designs are highly interactive and customized to business needs to maximize the impact of insights generated from datasets. Additionally, I have successfully used data cleaning techniques such as Pivot Tables and VLOOKUP to prepare datasets for analysis. I am also adept at creating tables, charts and graphs for better visualization of results in Tableau.

## Project 1: Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project (SQL)
In this project, I was using Microsoft SQL Server to clean [Nashville Housing dataset](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx). The Dataset has more than 56,000 rows and 19 columns.

The following tasks were performed:
- **Standardize date format**
- **Populate missing property address data**
- **Parsing long-formatted address into individual columns (Address, City, State)**
- **Standardize “Sold as Vacant” field (from Y/N to Yes and No)**
- **Remove Duplicates**
