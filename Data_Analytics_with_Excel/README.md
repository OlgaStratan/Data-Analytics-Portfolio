# Data Analytics Project with Excel

## In this analysis I was using excel for data cleaning, data analysis and data visualization.

## Tasks
- To create an interactive Dashboard to visualise the dataset and identify interesting patterns
- To find out who bought or didn’t buy a bike, by checking on different aspects, such as: Gender, Marital status, Education level, Income level and Commute distance.

## Data Collection
- The data used for this analysis was provided through Github - [Excel Project Dataset](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Excel-Tutorial/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx)
- This dataset contains 1206 unique entries with 13 columns containing demographic information of people who did or didn’t buy a bike.

## Exploratory Analysis / Data Cleaning
Explanatory analysis was performed with Excel to identify the quality of the dataset such as :
- Check the data types
- Check for duplicated entries (identified 26 duplicates)
- Update the abbreviation (e.g. M to Male; S to Single)
- Add additional column such as: Customer Age Brackets (Adolescent, Middle Age, Seniors)

## Data Visualization

## The main Findings
- Single men buy more bikes than single women.
- Men have higher average income and are more likely to buy bikes.
- The commute distance does influence the decision to by a bike (the shorter is commute time, more likely to buy the bike)
- Middle age people between 30 and 50 years buy more bikes than younger or older people.
- Men and women with no children bought bikes at the same level, with children - men bought more than women.

## Limitations
- Insufficient sample size for statistical measurements.
- Geographical locations are not equally represented.
